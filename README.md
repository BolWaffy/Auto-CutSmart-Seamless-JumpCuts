Say goodbye to ugly, streaky motion blur every time your Blender camera makes a jump cut.

You know the look: you animate a camera to instantly "jump" to a new position, but the final render shows a messy, streaky motion blur artifact.

Auto CutSmart is a free Blender addon that perfectly fixes this problem. It intelligently detects your jump cuts and splits your animation across two separate cameras. This simple trick makes Blender calculate motion blur correctly for each shot, giving you a perfectly clean, sharp, and professional transition every time.

## âœ¨ What is Auto CutSmart?

**Auto CutSmart** is a **free Blender addon** that fixes the ugly motion blur you get during a "jump cut" (when a camera instantly moves to a new position).

Instead of a blurry mess, the addon splits your animation across two cameras. This simple trick ensures Blender calculates the motion blur correctly, giving you a clean, seamless transition between shots.

## ðŸ§  **How It Works**

The addon automates three main steps:

1.  **Detects Jumps:** It scans your animation to find frames where the camera moves or rotates more than a certain amount.
2.  **Splits Animation:** It duplicates your camera (into "Camera A" and "Camera B") and divides the animation between them.
3.  **Switches Cameras:** It adds markers to your timeline that automatically switch between Camera A and Camera B at the exact moment of the cut. This creates a clean, motion-blur-free transition.
